The data used was for The Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory metropolis obtained from the meteorological station between 1743 and 2015. The results show how these parameters have influenced the weather observed in these months over the study period. Given enough data the observed trend over time could be examined and important deviations which show changes in climatic patterns identified. The primary goal of this study is to create a low-cost, trustworthy, and efficient weather forecast model that may be used in our daily life. The importance of forecasting the weather conditions and its different patterns is observed using time series analysis.
In forecasting the model, ARIMA is a really helpful and widely used statistical method.
